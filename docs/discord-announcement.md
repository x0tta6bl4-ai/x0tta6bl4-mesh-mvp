**🚀 Reality Map Initiative Launched — Honest Status of x0tta6bl4 Project**
Date: 2025-11-13 (Planned Publication)

**Why this matters:** Transparency builds trust. We’ve published a Reality Map documenting the true readiness of every major component (mesh, ML, PQC, privacy, censorship resistance, etc.).

**Key Highlights:**
- ✅ Mesh + rollback + DAO snapshot baseline are solid.
- ⚠️ GNN routing, Zero Trust policy, RAG optimization mid-stage.
- 🔴 Censorship resistance, federated learning, eBPF telemetry, DP & HE privacy, real PQC primitives — not yet implemented.

**What Changed:** We aligned overstated claims in previous documentation with what’s actually in the codebase. No more ambiguity.

**Top 5 Critical Actions (0–3 months):**
1. Finish GraphSAGE causal routing (A1)
2. Resolve censorship resistance claim (A2)
3. Implement differential privacy noise (A3)
4. Replace PQC mocks with real primitives (A4)
5. Maintain and evolve Reality Map (A5)

**Want to Help?**
- Contribute eBPF probes (packet loss + syscall latency)
- Implement censorship bypass (domain fronting, DPI evasion)
- Add homomorphic encryption / DP modules
- Benchmark performance with reproducible scripts

**How to Engage:**
- GitHub Discussion: (link to be added)
- Issues labeled: `reality-map`, `critical`, `component-*`
- Ask questions: open an Issue with label `reality-map-question`

**Weekly Updates:** Published every Tuesday (UTC) in `docs/reality-map-updates/` + posted here.

**Target Milestone:** Honest Production Readiness by Q2 2026 (not Q1 as previously stated).

Let’s build this the right way — openly. Drop a reaction to support transparency 💡
