**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because I saw [Company Name] is hiring [X] engineers. Scaling your team means scaling code review too.

**x0tta6bl4 for Enterprise:**

We work with teams at [Company A], [Company B], and [Company C] to:
1. **Automate security review** (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
2. **Reduce code review time** by 40%
3. **Prevent security incidents** before deployment

**Real results:**
- TechCorp: 89% reduction in security incidents
- StartupXYZ: Saved 200 engineering hours/month
- DevOps Inc: Caught $500K vulnerability before production

**Your custom solution:**
- On-premise deployment
- Custom security rules
- Dedicated support engineer
- 99.9% SLA
- Training for your team

**Next step:**  
I'd love to show you a demo with your codebase (anonymized).
