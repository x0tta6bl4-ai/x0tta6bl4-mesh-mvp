## 7653× Claim Status

**Validation**: ⚠️ PENDING BENCHMARKS

**Critical Note**: The "7653× improvement" claim is **NOT VALIDATED** and must **NOT** be used in:
- ❌ Marketing materials
- ❌ Investor pitches
- ❌ Public presentations
- ❌ Patent applications
- ❌ Academic papers (without clear "preliminary estimate" disclaimer)

**Baseline Requirements**:
1. Define baseline QAOA implementation (classical reference)
2. Establish problem set (e.g., MaxCut, portfolio optimization, TSP)
3. Run statistically significant number of trials (n≥50)
4. Measure: time-to-solution, solution quality, convergence rate
5. Document hardware, software versions, hyperparameters

**Timeline**:
- Baseline environment setup: 2025-11-10 (Week 1)
- Initial benchmark runs: 2025-11-20 (Week 3)
- Statistical analysis complete: 2025-12-01 (Week 4)
- Publication decision: 2026-01-15

See: `docs/BENCHMARK_README.md` for detailed methodology.

## Decision

Based on verification above, the recommendation is:

✅ **Reclassify as "Horizon 3 Roadmap Project"**

### Immediate Actions (Week 1):
1. Remove "7653×" from all public materials ✅ (RSA cleanup tonight)
2. Update PATENT_PORTFOLIO.md to reflect "research phase" status
3. Update IP_QUICK_START.md with correct categorization
4. Internal reference only: "preliminary algorithmic exploration"

### Short-Term Actions (Q1 2026):
1. Complete benchmark harness (Week 1-2)
2. Run baseline comparisons (Week 3-4)
3. Statistical validation (Week 5-6)
4. DAO review of results (Week 7)
5. Decision: File provisional patent OR continue research

### Long-Term Actions (Q2-Q3 2026):
- If benchmarks validate: File provisional patent application
- If benchmarks inconclusive: Refine algorithm and re-test
- If benchmarks negative: Pivot to alternative optimization approaches

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Benchmarks fail to validate claim | Medium | High | Pivot to proven mesh routing value proposition |
| Delayed benchmark environment | Low | Medium | Use mock/simulated data for initial tests |
| Prior art found during FTO | Medium | High | Emphasize unique aspects (cultural integration, DAO governance) |
| Patent examiner rejects | Low | Medium | Focus on narrow, defensible claims |

## Context for Stakeholders

### For Investors:
"φ-QAOA is a research initiative within x0tta6bl4's quantum optimization portfolio. Current focus is on production-ready mesh networking with post-quantum cryptography. Quantum optimization remains a strategic long-term opportunity pending validation."

### For Technical Team:
"Continue algorithm development and benchmark preparation. Priority: establish reproducible baseline and test harness by 2025-11-10. Patent filing contingent on validation results."

### For Marketing:
"Do not reference φ-QAOA or 7653× claim externally. Focus messaging on: self-healing mesh, post-quantum security, k-disjoint path resilience, Zero Trust enforcement."

### For Legal/IP Team:
"Monitor FTO landscape for QAOA-related patents. Begin drafting provisional claims assuming positive benchmark results (contingency planning). Coordinate with DAO on governance aspects of IP strategy."
